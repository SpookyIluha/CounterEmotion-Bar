Two ambitious aliens aboard a spaceship were exploring the vastness of the universe in search of a planet they could conquer for their creative experiments. One day, they come across a bright blue planet called Earth.

They observe the inhabitants of this planet and learn that they are extremely emotional beings. This strange thing — emotion — seems to be able to influence them so strongly that they literally lose control. Moreover, curious invaders discover that humans love to spend time in a place called a "bar." There, they suppress this excess of emotions, and it seems they are only happy about it. Our invaders have an incredible idea: to master the art of managing emotions. After all, it's such an unusual way to conquer another planet!
